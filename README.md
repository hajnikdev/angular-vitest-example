# angular-vitest-example

Modern Angular example application with Vitest testing, standalone components, and best practices.

---

This repository contains a modern Angular example application configured with Vitest for unit testing.
It demonstrates best practices for setting up Angular with standalone components, signals, and fast, lightweight testing using Vitest instead of Karma/Jasmine.

The goal of this project is to serve as a reference and learning resource for developers who want:

A clean Angular setup using the latest Angular recommendations

Vitest-based testing configuration for Angular

Practical examples of component, service, and utility tests

A simple, easy-to-understand project structure suitable for real-world applications

Ideal for developers migrating from Karma/Jasmine to Vitest or starting new Angular projects with modern tooling.
